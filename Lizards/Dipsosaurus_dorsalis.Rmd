Dipsosaurus dorsalis inhabit desert environments, thus often called as Desert Iguana. They are adapted to hot environments, and perform best at 40 °C (104 °F).
They measure 33 - 40 cm in length, two-thirds of which is the tail.
They are territorial and males often display aggressive behaviors to secure their mates. Their polygynous nature allows dominant males to mate with more females.
They are folivores that feed on a variety of plants with occasional consumption of insects.
