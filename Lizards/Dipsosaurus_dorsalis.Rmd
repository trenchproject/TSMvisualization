*Dipsosaurus dorsalis* inhabit desert environments, thus often called as Desert Iguana. They are adapted to hot environments, and perform best at 40 °C (104 °F).
They measure 33 - 40 cm in length, two-thirds of which is tail, and have a grayish brown body.
They are territorial and males often display aggressive behaviors to secure their mates and resources. Their polygynous nature allows dominant males to mate with more females. Mating occurrs from spring through midsummer and usually only one clutch of eggs are laid per season.  
In terms of diet, *D. dorsalis* are mainly folivores that feed on a variety of plants but occasionally eat insects as well.
