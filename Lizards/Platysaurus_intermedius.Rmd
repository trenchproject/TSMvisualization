Common name: Common Flat Lizard.

*Platysaurus intermedius* has 9 subspecies, all of which are found in southern Africa.  
The common name "flat lizard" comes from the fact that they are dorso-ventrally thin. This enables them to use narrow crevices as retreat sites, making them a rock specialist.  
In terms of appreance, sexual dichromatism is obvious in this species with males colorfully decorated while females are uniform and conservatively colored.
