Common name: Sagebrush Lizard.  
*Sceloporus graciosus* is a common lizard in central to western United States. They are mostly found in sagebrush cover but they also inhabit greasewood and other desert shrubs and sometimes small rocky outcrops as well.  
Their mating season is spring, and eggs are usually laid in June, which will then hatch in August. They stay inactive during the cold months of the year.
(Cossel, 1997)



Rose

prefers a more open habitat 

Seventy percent of
S. graciosus were found under shrubs, while this
habitat is 46% of the area. Thus, their results strongly
suggest that the lizards were selecting specific habitats rather than occurring in proportion to the available habitat. 





Sceloporus graciosus
 appears to use radiant energy to raise its
 body temperature since body temperatures
 were consistently higher than either the air
 or substratum temperatures
