Common name; Common side-blotched lizard  
*Uta stansburiana* are distributed from Northern Mexico to southeastern Washington in the United States. They are commonly found in desert washes, sand dune areas, sagebrush flats and boulder rocks (Stebbins, 2003).  
Their snout-vent length measures up to 6cm. One interesting fact about this lizard is that the males have three different throat colors; orange, blue or yellow depending on the individual. Since the most rare morph has the advantage over the others, none of the coloration is dominant, and the abudunce of color varies each year (Barreto et al., 2017).  
They lay eggs March through August, and the clutch size ranges from 1 to 8 (Stebbins, 2003).
