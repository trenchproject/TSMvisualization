Sceloporus grammicus is a widely distributed lizard species that inhabits a variety of ecosystems, mainly in Mexico.


Sceloporus
grammicus maintains a lower field Tb than most other Sceloporus species, including other montane species


flattened their body against warm rock surfaces in an
attempt to obtain warmth from them, as well as from solar
radiation. 


Rock
crevices in immediate proximity to basking sites provide
ample places to meet both thermoregulatory and predatoravoidance needs


lizards at Laguna live in a pine forest
with considerable shade that is constantly changing throughout the day. Thermoregulation requires constant movements
to sunny spots
