*Sphaerodactylus macrolepis* is a species of gecko found throughout the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico (Kelehear et al., 2017). They are generalist in terms of habitat selection and can be found in a variety of terrains in Pueto Rico.  
They are small in size, and adults only reaches about 7 cm including the tail, which makes them susecptible to extreme heat and dessication (Allen & Powell, 2014).  
This species is considered to be the densest terrestrial vertebrate in the world, with estimates reaching 67,600 geckos per hectare (Rodda et al., 2001). Their abundance plays a critical role in the ecosystem, serving as a rich food source for many predators.
