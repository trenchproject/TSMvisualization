*Elgaria multicarinata* are found in western United States, from Washington to California. They prefer grassland, open forest and chaparral habitat.  
They have a large head and a strong jaw, which enable them to bite with a lot of power.
They hibernate during colder months, mating occurs around April and May, and eggs hatch through summer and early fall.  
This species is long-living and known to live up to 15 years.
