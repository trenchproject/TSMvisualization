*Ctenotus regius* is a species of skinks exclusively found in Australia, mostly in arid sandy areas with sparse ground cover.  
They are medium-sized and fast-moving. Their back has white-edged dark longitudinal stripes and the sides have small white spots. Snout-vent length can be up to 80mm, and females are generally larger than males.  
Clutch size is about 2 eggs, and breeding occurs between November and February.
