Visualizations of thermal safety margins

We're developing tools (leveraging the biophysical models) for mapping and visualizing thermal stress and would ideally build tools relevant to the IPCC initiative of assessing and disseminating impacts of +1.5 vs +2C. We're exploring mapping out the thermal safety margin (TSM= CTmax - Te_max) across the ranges of species with CTmax data in the GlobTherm database. We plan to include a density plot of the species' TSM under baseline climates, +1.5C, +2C (and eventually also climate projections).
