<h3>Operative temperature</h3>

The temperature a given organism experiences can depart dramatically from air temperatures due to energy exchange with the environment. For instance, heat is gained by absorbing solar and thermal radiation and from metabolic reactions. It is also lost to the environment through the organism's emission of radiation and the evaporation of water. Additionally, heat exchange with air, water and ground via convection and conduction are constantly occurring. <b> Operative temperature </b> takes these factors into consideration and therefore is a more accurate representation of what the organism is actually experiencing compared to the air or ground temperature.

<h3>Thermal Performance Curve</h3>

The graph below is a thermal performance curve of a lizard species <em> Pseummodromus hispanicus </em>. A thermal performance curve typically takes temperature on the x-axis and the performance of the organism on the y-axis, which can be based off of survival or reproductive success. The curve is drawn based on the organism's critical thermal maximum, critical thermal minimum and their optimal tempearture. <br>
Critical thermal maximum and minimum are the highest and lowest temperatures that the organism can tolerete, respectively. The optimal temperature is the temperature that the organism attains the highest performance. <br>
Thermal performance curve has a gradual increase with temperature, reaches the critical thermal maximum before it drops sharply.
In other words, many organisms that are currently living in their optimal environment can be in danger if tempearture keeps increasing.

<h3> What is Thermal Safety Margin (TSM)? </h3>

<b>Thermal safety margin</b> is the difference between the operative temperature and the critical thermal maximum of a given organism. <br>
<br>

TSM indicates how much more the temperature can increase before the environment turns uninhabitable.  <br>

A positive TSM means the environmental temperature is within the thermal tolerance of the organism and a negative TSM implies that the operative temperature surpasses the critical thermal maximum. 


They are active when the thermal environment permits them to attain their preferred range of body temperatures
This suggests that lizards with longer potential activity days should grow faster than lizards experiencing short days

lizards with longer potential activity times were able to spend more time at their preferred temperature. That is where the rates of physiological processes involved in food  digestion, food  assimilation, metabolism, and conversion to somatic tissue are typically high.
Long-day lizards can experience higher average rates of these processes, and hence higher growth rates, per day.

Lizards with long-day had more time available for foraging and food intake as well.



TSM is a good indicator of whether the environment is suitable for certain organisms, and it has potential for predicting whether species will be able to keep surving in the same habitat in the world of accelerating climate change. <br>
<br>

In this platform, we use TSM to visualize and address the danger some species might face from increased temperature. <br>
